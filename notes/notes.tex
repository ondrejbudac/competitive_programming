\section{Floyd-Warshall algorithm}
It is a graph analysis algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights with no negative cycles.
A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, though it does not return details of the paths themselves.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm compares all possible paths through the graph between each pair of vertices.
It is able to do this with $\Theta(|V|^3)$ comparisons in a graph. 
This is remarkable considering that there may be up to $\Omega(|V|^2)$ edges in the graph, and every combination of edges is tested. 
It does so by incrementally improving an estimate on the shortest path between two vertices, until the estimate is optimal.

To detect negative cycles using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, one can inspect the diagonal of the path matrix, and the presence of a negative number indicates that the graph contains at least one negative cycle.

\subsection{Minimal path reconstruction} 
With simple modifications, it is possible to create a method to reconstruct the actual path between any two endpoint vertices. 
The Shortest-path tree can be calculated for each node in $\Theta(|E|)$ time using $\Theta(|V|)$ memory to store each tree which allows us to efficiently reconstruct a path from any two connected vertices.

\subsection{Widest path problem}
In graph algorithms, the \emph{widest path problem}, also known as the \emph{bottleneck shortest path problem} or the \emph{maximum capacity path problem}, is the problem of finding a path between two designated vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the path.
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be applied to solve this problem with minor modifications.
One has to reverse the inequality and the addition operation is replaced by the minimum operation.
